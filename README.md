# Mapwatch is no longer maintained.

Mapwatch used to show statistics about your recent Path of Exile mapping activity, based on your `client.txt` file.

Thanks for your love over the years!

## What can I use instead?

*For a current-map stopwatch*, the [Timekeeper's Map Device](https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/item/TimekeepersMapDeviceVariations) is available in the shop now. It's better than Mapwatch ever was - well worth the cost!

*For a history of your maps this league*, I'm not aware of any direct replacements. Heard good things about [Exilence CE](https://github.com/exilence-ce/exilence-ce) and [Poestack](https://poestack-next.vercel.app/), but haven't personally used either one. Good luck.

## I'm a developer. Can I fork Mapwatch and create my own version?

Yes, please do! I've lost interest, but wouldn't mind if someone else wants to maintain a fork.

The GPL license means you must keep your copy open-source. I'd also appreciate it if you used a different name for your fork, to avoid confusion.

## I'm a developer. Can you make me a maintainer of the original Mapwatch repository?

Absolutely not. I won't risk giving anyone the chance to backdoor Mapwatch, especially since it used to be connected to a downloadable program. If you'd like to keep Mapwatch going, please fork your own copy.
